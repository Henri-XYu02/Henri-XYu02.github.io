I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying [Computer Science](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu/). Currently I am interested in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and machine learning models related to time-series data.

Currently I am assisting PhD student [Zihao Zhou](https://zzhou.info/) with some temporal anomaly detection project. This summer I am working as a RA in [Professor Mingmin Chi](https://www.aminer.cn/profile/mingmin-chi/53f42fb6dabfaec22ba35802)'s lab on industrial anomaly detection dataset.

I plan to go for PhD study and am thinking about starting a personal project.
